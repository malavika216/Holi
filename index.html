    <h2>About Holi</h2>
    <p>Holi has deep roots in Indian mythology and tradition. Celebrated on the full moon day in the month of Phalguna (March), it marks the victory of good over evil and the change of seasons. The festival's origin lies in several legends, including the tale of Prahlad and Holika, which symbolizes faith and righteousness triumphing over tyranny.</p>
    <p>The burning of Holika on the eve of Holi is a ritual that reminds people to let go of negativity and start fresh. Bonfires are lit, songs are sung, and communities gather to reflect and rejoice.</p>
    <p>Another popular legend is that of Radha and Krishna, whose divine love is celebrated during Holi. Krishna, known for his playful spirit, colored Radha’s face — a moment now symbolized through the vibrant hues of Holi. It’s this mix of devotion, joy, and mischief that makes Holi so unique and beloved.</p>

    <h2>How Holi is Celebrated</h2>
    <p>Celebrations begin with Holika Dahan, where people gather around the fire to perform rituals and pray for the destruction of evil. The next morning, people of all ages step out to play Holi with colors, water balloons, and pichkaris (water guns).</p>
    <p>It’s a day filled with street music, traditional drumming (dhol), folk dances, and singing. Homes welcome guests with delicious sweets and snacks. Gujiya, malpua, dahi bhalla, and thandai are some of the festive favorites enjoyed by all.</p>
    <p>Holi goes beyond fun—it fosters friendship, forgiveness, and unity. In schools, offices, and neighborhoods, people come together to spread cheer. In recent years, eco-friendly Holi with herbal colors and dry powder has also gained popularity, promoting safe and sustainable celebrations.</p>
