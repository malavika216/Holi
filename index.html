    <h2>About Holi</h2>
    <p>Holi has roots in ancient Hindu mythology, especially the story of Prahlad and Holika. The night before Holi, people light bonfires in a ritual called Holika Dahan. It symbolizes the victory of good over evil and the burning away of negative energy. Holi usually takes place in March, on the full moon day. It is widely celebrated across India and even in other parts of the world.</p>
    <p>Beyond this central legend, Holi’s traditions vary by region. In Bengal, it’s called Dol Jatra, marked by colorful processions and devotional songs for Lord Krishna. In Punjab, the Sikh community celebrates Hola Mohalla with martial arts displays and kirtan. Historical records show Holi celebrations dating back over a thousand years in royal courts. Today, it links India’s rich heritage with a modern spirit of inclusivity and fun.</p>

    <h2>How Holi is Celebrated</h2>
    <p>On Holi, people gather in open areas to smear each other with colorful powders. Water balloons and pichkaris (water guns) add to the excitement. Traditional sweets like Gujiya and refreshing drinks like Thandai are shared among everyone. Music, drums, and folk dances fill the streets with energy. The festival fosters happiness, forgiveness, and a sense of renewal.</p>
    <p>Community fairs (melas) often spring up, featuring local crafts, dance performances, and street food stalls. Many now choose eco‑friendly or herbal colors to protect skin and the environment. Some regions observe a “dry” Holi to conserve water, while others splash rain‑dance style celebrations. Both traditional and modern music amplify the festive vibe. The day ends with prayers for health, prosperity, and lasting friendships.</p>
